**Here’s how to get started:**

  * Gather your friends, family, and colleagues who are interested in helping the Dedham Food Pantry
  * Create a fundraiser to help raise funds and awareness.
  * Reach out to your networks to secure support for your fundraising campaign. **Please <a href="/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a> if you have any questions.**

*As people responsible for fundraising for non-profit organizations, we often get “analysis paralysis,” the inability to decide on a course of action.  We spend so much time reviewing great new fundraising strategies, attending conferences, reading development books, and seeking advice from colleagues that we have trouble launching a new fundraising initiative.

Here are some ideas to fundraise:

1.  Hold a [fundraising event][1].

2.  Send a [fundraising letter][2] to your donor file.

3.  Host a walk-a-thon, dance-a-thon, or other [participatory fundraising event][3].

4.  [Write some grants][4].

5.  Send a [fundraising e-mail][5] to your list.

6.  Approach your top supporters to ask for[ individual gifts][6].

7.  Start a [viral fundraising][7] campaign.

8.  Launch a [board giving campaign][8].

9.  [Recruit volunteers to raise money][9] on your behalf.

10.  Host a [cookbook fundraiser][10] or a [candy bar fundraiser][11].

11.  Find donors to run[ hosted events][12].

12.  Seek out a [major donor][13] to fund the project.

13.  Use [scratch cards][14].

14.  Hold a [silent auction][15].

15.  Choose [an unusual fundraising idea][16].

16.  Choose a [“quick” fundraising idea][17].

17.  Find in-kind donations to meet your need, rather than asking for checks.

By no means is this an exhaustive list.  These 17 ideas should, however, provide a great starting point for deciding on your organization’s strategy for raising a quick $10,000, $25,000, or whatever you need to help you accomplish your mission.
