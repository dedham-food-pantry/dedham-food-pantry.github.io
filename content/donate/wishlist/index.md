We purchase most of our food from the Greater Boston Food Bank where $1 buys about $3 worth of food.
[Cash donations][1] are always appreciated and go far.
There are some items, however, that we are not able to purchase and which we depend on from your donations.
In addition, donated foods provide our clients with different brands and flavors and they appreciate the variety!
