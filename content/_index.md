# About Us

OurÂ mission is to **end hunger in Dedham**. We distribute more than 28,000 bags of food annually to more than 500 households in Dedham: families with children, people with disabilities, senior citizens, and any Dedham residents who need help due to loss of employment, reduction in benefits, or just living on a fixed income.

Our organization is non-denominational, non-political, run by volunteers, and funded entirely by [contributions][2].
