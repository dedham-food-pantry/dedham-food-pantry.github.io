# [About Us][7]

OurÂ mission is to **end hunger in Dedham**. Everyone deserves consistent access to healthy food and the dignity of support without judgment.

We distribute more than 28,000 bags of food annually to more than 500 households in Dedham: families with children, people with disabilities, and senior citizens. We're here for any Dedham resident who needs help due to loss of employment, reduction in benefits, or just living on a limited income.

Our organization is non-denominational, non-political, run by volunteers, and funded entirely by [contributions][2].
