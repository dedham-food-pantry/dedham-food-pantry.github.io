Once the Dedham Food Pantry has processed your form and verified your residence in Dedham, you will be eligible to shop.
Due to surging demand we require that you [make a reservation to shop](signup).

Please note:

* If you're not a Dedham resident then there are [several nearby pantries that can help you][5].
* Residents of emergency shelters in Dedham are not eligible to shop at the Pantry, but we work with the shelters to provide supplemental food.
* All persons who live in the same housing unit are considered one household even if they are not related.
* The Pantry’s income guidelines are based on the total income of all persons in your household from all income sources.
* Count only the current income of household members, not what they may have made in the past or what they expect to make in the future. However, if your income increases to the point where you are no longer eligible for assistance please let us know.
* The Pantry does not consider the amount of your bank accounts or other assets. If you have significant assets but a limited income, please consider whether it is appropriate for you to use the Food Pantry.
