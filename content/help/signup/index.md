The Dedham Food Pantry is open for shopping every Saturday morning and the first and third Wednesday evening of each month. We're open for senior citizens on the second and fourth Wednesday afternoon of each month. [Our calendar][1] lists the upcoming dates and times.

[Reserve Shopping][2] lets you make an appointment to shop. Appointments are first come, first serve, so you may not get your preferred shopping time.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Reserve Shopping* is not mandatory, however, we have been experiencing very high demand lately and walk-ins **will be given a shopping time when ALL clients have completed their shopping**.</span>
