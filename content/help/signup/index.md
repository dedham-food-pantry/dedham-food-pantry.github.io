The Dedham Food Pantry is open for shopping at these times:
* Family Shopping: every Saturday morning, and the first and third Wednesday evening of each month
* Senior Citizens: the second and fourth Wednesday afternoon of each month.

[Our calendar][1] lists the upcoming dates and times.

[Reserve Shopping][2] lets you make an appointment to shop. Appointments are first come, first serve, so you may not get your preferred shopping time.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Reserve Shopping* is not mandatory, however, we have been experiencing very high demand lately and walk-ins **will be given a shopping time when ALL clients have completed their shopping**.</span>
