## [Rescue Food][4]

Much of our food is "rescued" by volunteers who pick it up at local stores and restaurants and bring it to us.

* Volunteer must be a licensed driver, and must have a vehicle
* Must be able to lift several boxes of food donations

We partner with [Food Rescue US][3], a non-profit that coordinates food rescues locally and nationwide. Please [sign up with them][4] and pick one of our rescues!
