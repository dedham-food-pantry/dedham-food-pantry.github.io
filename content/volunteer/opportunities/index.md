YOU can help end hunger in our community by volunteering for the Dedham Food Pantry! If you have two or more hours to spare, please consider joining our team. _Volunteers under 16 years of age must be accompanied by an adult._

Please check out the tasks below, find an opportunity that interests you, and [**register online**][2].

If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="/contact/">reach out to us</a>.

## Client Shopping

Our most urgent need is for volunteers to help our clients get the food that they need.

We have opportunities on Saturday morning (4 hours - 7:45-11:45am), the first and third Wednesday of every month (2 hours - 5:00-7:00pm), and the second and fourth Wednesday of every month (2 hours - 12:30-2:30pm).

* Work 1-on-1 with clients to help them shop
* Work outdoors helping clients load their food into their vehicles
* Break down boxes for recycling

If this interests you, please [register online][2].

## Food Rescue

Much of our food is "rescued" by volunteers who pick it up at local stores and restaurants and bring it to us.

* Volunteer must be a licensed driver, and must have a vehicle
* Must be able to lift several boxes of food donations

We partner with [Food Rescue US][3], a non-profit that coordinates food rescues locally and nationwide. Please [sign up with them][4] and pick one of our rescues!

## Behind the Scenes

### Stocking Crew

We're here every week from 10:00am-noon getting the Pantry ready for our clients:

* Sort food donations and check expiration dates
* restock shelves
* recycle boxes
* light cleaning
* ...and other duties

If this interests you, please [register online][2].

### Unload Food Bank Provisions

We get three deliveries each month from the Greater Boston Food Bank. The food arrives in a truck and has to be moved into the Pantry.

* Must be able to lift up to 30 lbs repetitively, must be able to reach overhead, and also some bending and turning.

If this interests you, please [register online][2].
