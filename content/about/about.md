The Dedham Food Pantry was established in 1990 with the mission to end hunger in Dedham. Everyone deserves consistent access to healthy food and the dignity of support without judgment. We serve approximately 250 Dedham families each month. Approximately one-third of those served are children.

We distribute a variety of non-perishable pantry staples; perishable items such as meat, eggs, cheese and bread; and fresh seasonal produce when available. We obtain our food from a variety of sources including purchasing from the Greater Boston Food Bank; receiving donated food from individual, community, or corporate food drives; purchasing from warehouse and thrift stores; receiving donated food from grocery stores; and receiving donated produce from local farms.

Food distribution is based on family size, availability, and special dietary needs. We also offer personal hygiene items including shampoo, soap, toothpaste, and feminine hygiene products.

Pantry operations are supported entirely by generous and dedicated [volunteers][1].

The Dedham Food Pantry is governed by a volunteer [Board of Trustees][2].
