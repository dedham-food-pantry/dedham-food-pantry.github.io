Established in [1990][4], the Dedham Food Pantry is a cornerstone of community support with a bold mission: to end hunger in Dedham. We serve approximately 250 Dedham families (with more than 750 family members) each month. Approximately one-third of the people that we serve are children.

We distribute a variety of non-perishable pantry staples; perishable items such as meat, eggs, cheese and bread; and fresh seasonal produce when available. We obtain food from a variety of sources including purchasing from the Greater Boston Food Bank; receiving donated food from individual, community, or corporate food drives; purchasing from warehouse and thrift stores; receiving donated food from grocery stores; and receiving donated produce from local farms. We also offer personal hygiene items including shampoo, soap, toothpaste, and feminine hygiene products.

We believe that everyone deserves consistent access to healthy food and the dignity of support without judgment.

The Pantry is non-denominational, non-political, and supported by generous [donors][1] and dedicated [volunteers][2], including a volunteer [Board of Trustees][3].
