The Dedham Junior Woman's Club's 31st Annual Craft Show will be held Saturday **November 17** from **9 am to 3 pm** at the **Dedham Middle School**, 70 Whiting Ave.
This year the craft fair is bigger and better than ever, having expanded and using more space at the Middle school.

Over 80 juried crafters will be offering their works in jewelry, gourmet food items, gift baskets, women's and children's clothing and accessories, pottery, ceramics, holiday ornaments and home decor, plus much more.
Luncheon will be served in the cafeteria and shoppers can take a chance to win something from their favorite crafter at the crafters' raffle table.
Admission is $3 per person with children under 12 free.
All proceeds will be used to support local charities and organizations plus fund the two annual scholarships that are awarded each year to a Dedham High School senior and a woman returning to college.
