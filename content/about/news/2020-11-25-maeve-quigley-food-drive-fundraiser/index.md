Many thanks to Maeve Quigley for organizing a food drive & fundraiser which raised $1,000 to benefit the Dedham Food Pantry. The effort collected food donations & contributions from as far as Maine, Ohio and Virginia. Maeve and her mother Kathryn Aldrich Quigley delivered 150 flyers to their neighborhood and brought 25 to her school, posted online and yard signs.

A big shoutout goes to the Quigleys, your friends, family, neighbors and Mariposa Childcare. Your contributions will go a long way to helping the less fortunate. Thank you!
