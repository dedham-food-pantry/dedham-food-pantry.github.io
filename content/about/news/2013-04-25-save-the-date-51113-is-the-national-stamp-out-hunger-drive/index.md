On Saturday May 11th, 2013 the Noble and Greenough School will partner with The Dedham Letter Carriers Union to process donations for the National Stamp Out Hunger Drive. It is the largest one day food collection in the country. Volunteers are needed from Noon - 5PM at the Noble and Greenough School Buildings and Grounds Garage. Donations are unloaded and sorted for the Dedham Food Pantry.
