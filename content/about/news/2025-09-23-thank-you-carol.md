Carol Dixon is leaving our board of trustees after 10 years of service.

**Thank you Carol!**

Carol has been instrumental to our efforts to serve Dedham senior citizens, and works tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that we're in compliance with GBFB's reporting requirements.

Luckily for us, Carol has indicated that she will continue to serve our senior citizens, which I know they will appreciate.

If you see Carol, please thank her for her long and altruistic service.
