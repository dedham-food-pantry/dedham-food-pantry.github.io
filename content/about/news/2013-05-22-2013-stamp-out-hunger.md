The Dedham Food Pantry is the fortunate recipient of the fourteenth annual Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. Much gratitude is owed to the Letter Carriers and the Noble and Greenough community. Not only did our local postal workers collect food from households across town, they also staffed a very tasty barbecue lunch for the volunteers at the collection and sorting site, Noble and Greenough School.

Special thanks go to Coordinator Extraordinaire, Linda Hurley, Noble's Community Service Coordinator who spearheads this very successful drive and helps the pantry in numerous ways throughout the year.
