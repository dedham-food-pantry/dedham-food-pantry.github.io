Saturday, May 10, 2014 will mark the 22nd anniversary of one of America's great days of giving: the National Association of Letter Carriers Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive.

Letter carriers walk through the community every day, often coming face to face with a sad reality for too many: hunger.

So each year on the second Saturday in May, letter carriers across the country collect nonperishable food donations from our customers. These donations will go directly to the Dedham Food Pantry to provide food for people in the community.

Please do your part in helping us this year, as there has been a surge in Dedham families seeking our services.
