The Dedham Food Pantry takes part in the #GivingTuesday annual event on **Dec. 1, 2020**! The global pandemic has had a negative effect in our budget, as we continue to experience a surge in local families needing our services. _Your donation covers food purchases which guarantees that each family will have food on their table._

Here are some ways you can get involved with our mission on #GivingTuesday to help us:

  * <a href="https://www.paypal.com/fundraiser/charity/106215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donate online</a>, or mail at: <strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: inherit; color: inherit;">P. O.Â Box 46 Dedham, MA 02027**
  * Get Involved - volunteer, organize a food drive, support our local Partners
  * Spread the word about our mission by telling your friends and family.
