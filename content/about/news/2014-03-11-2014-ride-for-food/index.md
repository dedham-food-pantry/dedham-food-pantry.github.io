Well it's almost time to get the bike thawed out and ready for a ride, or at least to start thinking about our upcoming Ride for Food on Sunday morning the 21st of September. The Ride again will originate from Nobles with a 12, 25 and 50 mile route venues. The website is in the process of getting updated, but please go to [www.threesquaresne.org][1] for more information. We hope to have the website open for registrations in mid-April. &#8220;Like&#8221; us on Facebook by visiting our Three Squares New England page so that you can get updates as they become available.

Teams from all over the Boston area participated last year, and this year should be no different. In addition to the great group of organizations riding last year, we will possibly have a few more new teams including the Boston Area Gleaners and The Food Project. The total amount of money raised was approximately $123,000 with the Dedham Food Pantry team raising the most and going home with the Sprocket Trophy. Last year we had 42 people ride on our team, raised $32,050 from friends and family, and received a distribution of $36,393 for a 13.5% bonus. We'd love to have your support and repeat our success at even a higher rate, all for a great cause.

Those who participated last year know that the Ride for Food is a lot of fun. We have a great team organizing the Ride, but if anyone would like to assist with any aspect of organizing the event or teams, please contact Greg Jundanian at <greg@threesquaresne.org>. We'd love to have you join us.
